# Releasing

- **Cut a release:** `just release-patch | release-minor | release-major`
  (`scripts/release.sh`). It prechecks (on main, clean tree, in sync with origin,
  tag free), bumps the version in lockstep across `Cargo.toml` (workspace + the
  `diffler-core` dep), `npm/diffler`, and `npm/diffler-mcp`, runs `just ci`, then
  commits, tags `vX.Y.Z`, and pushes. The version lives in the manifests; the tag
  mirrors them.
- **CI does the rest** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`, tag-triggered) via
  **OIDC trusted publishing (no stored tokens)**: build 6 prebuilt targets →
  publish the GitHub release → crates.io (`diffler-core` + `diffler`) + npm
  (`@mattfillipe/diffler` binary wrapper + `diffler-mcp` proxy). The
  `package-managers` job renders + commits Homebrew (`Formula/`), Scoop
  (`bucket/`), AUR (`packaging/aur/`), and the Nix `flake.nix` (validated with
  `nix build` before committing).
- **AUR push is manual:** `just aur-publish` (`scripts/aur-push.sh`) with your
  local AUR SSH key.
- **Channels:** crates.io, npm ×2, GitHub releases, cargo-binstall, Homebrew tap,
  Scoop bucket, AUR (`diffler-bin`), Nix flake.
